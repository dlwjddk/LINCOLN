                <p>Lincoln's first creator was Henry Leland, co-founder of GM with William Durant. Henry Leland, who founded Cadillac as an auto parts company, founded the GM group with William Durant. In 1915, they developed the V8 engine and successfully put it into practice. Leland established aircraft engines during World War I and sought to transform into a military company, but Leland eventually left Cadillac due to the confrontation between Leland, who wanted to build airplane engines, and Durant, who insisted on automobiles. Later, Leland began rebuilding automobile engines and formally founded the Lincoln Motor Company in 1917, named after President Lincoln, whom he most admired. Leland has been responsible for the development of Ford's luxury cars ever since the Lincoln brand was incorporated into Ford in 1922.</p>

                <p>Lincoln established itself as a premium American luxury car. The most famous of Ford's custom-made vehicles is the 1922 Lincoln Town Car, built by his son Edsel Ford for his father, Henry Ford.
The name of the town car is derived from the body design with the driver's seat exposed and the passenger seat separated. Lincoln Town Cars took cars to the next level as a symbol of noble status rather than a means of transportation, and celebrities such as Thomas Edison, W.C Fields and Herbert Hooper loved Lincoln.</p>

                <p>LHenry Ford's son Edsel Ford decided to launch a new car Lincoln Continental around 1938 and led the development of a new car, generating an explosive response from customers. Lincoln Continental has created a cleanly falling design and a dynamic new image. Frank Lloyd Wright, a world-renowned architect who designed the Guggenheim Museum in New York, called Lincoln “the most beautiful car in the world,” and the New York Museum of Modern Art also named Lincoln as “the first car brand to be called a car of outstanding design”.</p>

                <p>Options such as power steering, power brakes, power windows, wide-angle windshield, tubeless tires and automatic seats are starting to be fitted to the Lincoln Premier. Lincoln's design has also been transformed into a futuristic look, and the Continental Mark II has created a new style look for Lincoln. At the time, Lincoln was rated as the most beautiful and influential car of the century.</p>

                <p>The New Continental was rated more than just a new car. In contrast to the glamor of the time, the New Continental was designed with a focus on simplicity and sophistication. In 1961, the Continental had either a hard top or a convertible model with a coach door opening in the middle. Like the original Continental in 1939, the New Continental changed Lincoln's image all at once. The New Continental became the first car to receive the Design of the Year Award from the prestigious American Industrial Design Association.</p>

                <p>In the 1980s, Lincoln faced a breakthrough. In 1984, the Mark VII reached the top position in the personal luxury coupe category, and the New Continental drew attention as Lincoln's first all-wheel drive. Town cars and other models continued to succeed, making Lincoln a leader in the automotive sector with a total sales of 280,659.</p>

Even in these circumstances, Lincoln was always able to maintain the top position. The 1990 town car was named MotorTrend's “Car of the Year” and once again took the top spot with the launch of the Mark VIII with a dramatic exterior and driver-focused interior. In 1998, the first full-size ultra-luxury LUV, the Navigator, was launched, and with its grandeur and luxury that takes advantage of the traditional Lincoln character, the Navigator is called the'King-of-the-Road' and gained great popularity from the younger generation.</p>
